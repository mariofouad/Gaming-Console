# Overview
This was the project of the "Microprocessors" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. Required to implement a gaming console, same look and feel as Atari 2600, Nintendo
Switch, or Gameboy Advance. The console must support 2 different working games. Any software must be written in ARM assembly, no physical connection should be present between the game console and any other external device (not connected to the computer)
# Components
* Any ARM-based microcontroller
* TFT screen display, with an internal ILI9341 controller (displays with other
controllers are allowed, but you will interface with this controller in your labs).
Touch screen is not required.
* 4 arcade buttons for movement.
* 2 arcade buttons for control.
* Power supply circuit
* Outer casing

# How To Run
Using ARM Keil program:
1. Download all files on your local machine.
2. Open "Game-Console" folder.
3. Open "Project" file, using Visual Studio.
4. Flash the code on the STM microcontroller (F8).
# How To Use
1. Press on the rest button on the microcontroller
2. Press on the green button for "Super Mario" Game or the yellow button for "Snake" Game from the Arcade buttons.
